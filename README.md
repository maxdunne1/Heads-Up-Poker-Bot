Heads-Up Poker Bot
  This project is a Python-based bot designed to assist in Heads-Up Spin & Go poker games. It provides Game Theory Optimal (GTO) decisions for preflop scenarios and detailed postflop analysis of hand ranges. It uses pre-solved ranges for 25 Big Blinds vs 25 Big Blinds.

Features
Preflop Analysis
  The bot evaluates your position, hole cards, and the sequence of betting actions.
  It suggests the optimal GTO move (e.g., fold, call, or raise) based on the current state of the game.
Postflop Analysis
  Displays a table showing the likelihood of each card being in your hand or your opponent's hand.
  The probabilities are calculated based on the ranges of each player, updated dynamically as actions progress.
